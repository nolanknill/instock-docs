### Diving Deeper #1: Sorting

Implementing sorting (ICM-28)

- To implement sorting, build your API to allow two query parameters: `sort_by` and `order_by`.
  - `sort_by` takes the column name as a value.
  - `order_by` can be one of two values: `asc` or ascending, or `desc` for descending. `order_by` is optional and defaults to `asc`.
- This feature applies to all columns in all Warehouse and Inventory GET requests.
- Examples:

  - `GET /api/warehouses?sort_by=warehouse_name` - Sorts results by Warehouse name in ascending order
  - `GET /api/warehouses?sort_by=warehouse_name&order_by=asc` - Sorts results by Warehouse name in ascending order
  - `GET /api/warehouses?sort_by=warehouse_name&order_by=desc` - Sorts results by Warehouse name in ascending order
  - `GET /api/inventories?sort_by=inventory_item&order_by=asc` - Sorts results by Inventory item in ascending order

- NOTE: The JIRA task explicitly asks for sorting functionality on the FE AND the backend.

### Diving Deeper #2: Filtering

Implementing filtering (ICM-31)

- To implement filtering, build your API to allow the query parameter: `s`. `s` takes the filter term as a value. Depending on the API, the search term should filter the following fields:

  - `/api/warehouses`: The term should filter the Warehouse, Address, Contact Name, and Contact Information columns.
  - `/api/inventories`: The term should filter the Inventory Item and Category columns.

- When you search for a keyword, it needs to check all fields as mentioned above for matches and should display matching items in the API results.

  - `GET /api/warehouses?s=Seattle` - "Seattle" is a warehouse name and address, so this would match.
  - `GET /api/inventories?s=Accessories` - "Accessories" is an inventory category, so this would match.

- NOTE: While filter terms should be case insensitive in "real life," terms can be case sensitive for now.
- NOTE: While the JIRA task explicitly asks for filtering (search functionality) to be implemented on the FE, think of this as an additional challenge.
